# crypto_scraper
The aim of this project was to scrape some price data on a couple of crypto
coins, I wanted to achieve this using scrapy, and I wanted to get a significant 
amount of data to analyze.
The site I scraped is called https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/ and has 
information stored on several crypto coins.
Provided the website doesn't hange much ill be able to update the data weekly
After running the project again, I was able to get mroe current data from this scraper, meaning the site hasnt changed too much
